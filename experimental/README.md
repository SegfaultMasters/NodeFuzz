THIS FOLDER CONTAINS EXPERIMENTAL MODULES 

Many people have been asking about using NodeFuzz with different targets and platforms.

I have been planning on sharing all these files as "release quality" modules at some
point, but looks like I'll never actually have time to refactor/clean them up.

These modules are not necessarily working as they are, and may lack dependencies, but
I hope that they can provide some reference on how you can get started for your setup.
